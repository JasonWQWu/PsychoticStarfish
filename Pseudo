for loop 
    if the filename is not found output error and return false


[void progress()]
a pair of floats called CalcGrade with work as the parameter

sets variable assignldx
    calls FindWork function with the assignment names

finally calls upon updateCSV with work being in the parameter

[updateCSV()]


for loop to loop through the size of the work


[int FindWork(string name)]
